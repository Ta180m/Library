# Templates


## About
 
 - `basic.cpp` is a minimalistic template for online contests like Codeforces and AtCoder
 
 - `template.cpp` is a lightweight template for online contests
 

## Notes
 
 - Symlink these files from the repository to your home directory as `.b`, `.t`, and `.u`, so you can easily `cp ~/.b main.cpp` and `cat ~/.t`
 
 - The line `if (fopen("in", "r")) freopen("in", "r", stdin), freopen("out", "w", stdout);` is to redirect input and  output to files `in` and `out`, if they exist
